# Substrings

#### Parameters

(Strings, Dictionary)

#### Returns

Hash

## Problems

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

## What I used

Ruby arrays, strings, hashes and TDD

## What I learned

How to create a hash, iterate over an array, use scan string method and create tests on rspec
